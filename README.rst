Spot-Feed-Reader
================

A Django module to retrieve multiple Spot device (www.findmespot.com) feeds and save them in your database.
See their feed page at http://faq.findmespot.com/index.php?action=showEntry&data=69

Spot products are products of Spot LLC ©

Why
===
The web interface they offer in their service isn't so good and it's hard to include it
in your own pages. Since they offer a feed service, the best thing available is to get all
the points you need and create your own map, the way you want it. Moreover you won't be limited
in the number of points, or their 3 months time limit to display or download them.
I originally wrote this small module to keep track of all our points during a one year
round world trip (http://come-away-with.me).
